              The Nebraska Humane Society was founded in 1875. It is the fifth oldest humane society in the nation, and, today, is also one of the largest. We offer shelter to animals who have no place to call home and provide vital services to them and to the people who love them. Every year, more than 24,000 animals, including wildlife, find their way to our doors. Through our programs, we touch the lives of more than 200,000 people annually with our message of compassion and humane treatment for all living creatures. We are housed on a 13-acre campus with four buildings, 170 dedicated staff members and 500 volunteers.

            <p id="cardlabel">
              The Nebraska Humane Society was founded in 1875. The organization was originally established for the protection of both animals and children. In the mid 1940â€™s, state agencies began to embrace child welfare issues, leaving the Nebraska Humane Society as the sole organization within the Omaha area designated for the protection of animals.

            <p id="cardlabel">
            NHS is a private, not for profit 501-C3 organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. As a non-profit agency we rely on private donations to keep our doors (and kennels) open. We do not receive tax dollars, nor do we receive any portion of dues or donations paid to national animal welfare agencies. 
            We rely on donations from annual donors who include individuals, corporations and foundations to fund the cost of sheltering tens of thousands of animals, our animal medical program, animal care facilities, adoption counseling, pet training and our behavior modification program, The Molly Project. NHS also works to generate income through our adoption fees, Animal Outfitters retail store and services such as training classes, humane education camps, and private pet cremations. 
            NHS provides education, gives sanctuary to animals, encourages adoptions and promotes responsible pet ownership.
