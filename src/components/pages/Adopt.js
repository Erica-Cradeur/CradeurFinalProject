          <p id="dawgcaption">My name is Seve. I am a lengthy boy looking for his new forever family. I can be shy, timid and slow to warm up to new people. However, when I gain confidence and trust with you I use my long legs to my advantage. I like to jump up on my friends, especially the men. Man's best friend am I right! I LOVE to play fetch. A home with a nice big yard to chase tennis balls in would be my dream home. I would do best in a home where all humans are at least adults. Little ones can be overwhelming for me. If there are any other dogs in the home, I would prefer they be on the calmer side. Before going home I want to meet all family members and any resident dogs to ensure we'll be a good match. If you are looking to be the apple of a new friends eye, consider adopting me!

          <p id="dawgcaption">My name is Kona. I am a shy girl who is looking for a patient and kind family who is willing to help me build my confidence and basic manners. I benefit from the use of positive reinforcement training and need a family who has experience with fearful dogs. I have a timid personality, but once I make friends, I am jittery and full of energy like a little lightening bug. I would do best in an adult only home. Apartment life would probably be too overwhelming for me. If there are any other dogs in the home, I will need to meet them beforehand to see if we are a good match. If you are looking for a dog to pour love, training, and confidence into, consider adopting me!

          <p id="dawgcaption">My name is Squilliam. I am a sweet big boy who can be fearful of new people and places and need a home where I can warm up at my own pace. I need to live in a house rather than an apartment, and need a fenced in yard. Little humans may be a little too much for me, I will do best in an adult only home. In the Omaha area, I am required to wear my muzzle and harness when out and about due to my breed. Because of this, my new family will also need to have proof of insurance before adopting me.

          <p id="dawgcaption">Meet Axel, I'm what they call an ambivert. I enjoy being with people and can be outgoing, but there are times when I just want to have some "me" time by exploring my surroundings or taking a good snooze in front of the TV. I Would like to go to a home where kids are at least 12, and meet any other dogs in the home.

          <p id="dawgcaption"><br />My name is Mila. I'm a happy pup but I can also be nervous at times when I'm around a lot of people or commotion. I get along with most people and other dogs if there isn't too much happening at once. I just prefer the company of adults, as little ones are just too much for me. I may do best as the only dog in the home but I would love to meet all of your dogs to see if I could be a fit; maybe it will be a match made in heaven!</p>
